### To run the code:
To run the code it is necessary to run operations in the following order:
- Open the terminal and run the makefile with the command: `make`

- After this command, a executable file: check_pid is created.


- To check which processes are running on the computer, we will use a command:  ` ps -aux `
 
 
- To run the program, write the following command:  `./check_pid "pid"  `

- For example:

 `./check_pid 2003 `
 
 - If we want permission, we will write first: `sudo`
